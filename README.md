# Fractality - Regex Fractal Generator
###### Fractality is a fractal generator based on regular expression.

### Usage:
-r arg	The regular expression used to generate the fractal  
-f arg	Defines the fractal coloring function (optional)  
-p arg	The primary color used on the coloring function  
-s arg	The secondary color used on the coloring function  
-d <arg>	The detail depth of the fractal (optional)  

OBS:  
The arguments don't need to be in order;  
All arguments need to be in quotes;  
Note that the depth must be a number between 1 and 9, as it increases exponencially the amount of memory needed to generate the fractal.  


### Coloring functions:
- crazy

### Regular Expresison examples:
- (23|41|34|12)
- (13|31|24|42)
